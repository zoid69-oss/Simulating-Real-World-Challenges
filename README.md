# Simulating-Real-World-Challenges
To sharpen my skills in quantitative finance and trading, I successfully simulated 10 advanced projects, inspired by real-world challenges from top HFT firms, hedge funds, and trading competitions. Over the course of this journey, I analyzed millions of data points and implemented multiple machine learning models to tackle complex, real-world problems.
